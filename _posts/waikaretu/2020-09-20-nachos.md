Can be cooked on a gas hob, open fire embers, or camp oven

10 serves

## Ingredients

* 1 Tbs oil
* 1 large or 2 medium sized onions – chopped small
* 2 to 3 cloves garlic – chopped or crushed
* 500 to 600g ground beef, or finely chopped gravy beef
* 2 rounded teaspoons ground cumin
* 2 teaspoons dried oregano
* pinch of chilli powder – if the patrol wants this
* 1 tsb ground black pepper
* 2 cans diced tomatoes in puree
* 1 sachet tomato paste, ~200 g
* 1 ½ cups red lentils
* 2 carrots – grated
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 cans red kidney beans
* water as needed

## Method

Heat the oil gently in a large pan or pot.  Sauté the chopped onion and garlic until transparent

Add the mince and stir and break up until brown all over

Add the cumin, oregano, chilli and pepper, and stir around until fragrant. This should only take a few seconds

Add the tomatoes and enough water to make quite a wet/sloppy mixture

Bring to the boil, then pour in the red lentils. Stir well and simmer for 20 minutes, until lentils are soft. Add more water if it gets too dry

Stir in grated carrots and drained kidney beans, and simmer for another 10 minutes

Add half of the salt and check the flavour. The canned beans and tomatoes can already be high in salt. Add the rest of the salt only if required

Serve with corn chips (preferably warmed), grated cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and fresh veges or salads
