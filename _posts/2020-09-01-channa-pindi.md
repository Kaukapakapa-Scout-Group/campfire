Can be cooked on a gas hob, or open fire embers

6 serves

## Ingredients

* 50 ml peanut oil
* 500 g prepared chickpeas or 2 cans of chickpeas, drained (reserve fluid)
* 150 g chopped onion (1 large)
* 30 g chopped fresh ginger, or equivalent of crushed ginger from jar
* 20 g chopped garlic, or equivalent of crushed garlic from jar (4 to 6 cloves)
* 5 g ground coriander (2 tsp)
* 5 g ground cumin (2 tsp)
* Salt to taste
* 500 g chopped tomatoes, or 2 cans of chopped tomatoes in juice
* 50 g chopped parsley or coriander (stalk and all), any combination (½ bunch)
* 5 g chopped fresh mint (optional)
* 50 ml lemon or lime juice, any combination (1 lemon, 1½  limes)

## Method

Use a large saucepan or large fry pan with high sides add half the oil, and heat on medium, add chickpeas and let them slowly fry, swirl or gently shake pan to rotate chickpeas so they don't burn, spend 10 to 15 minutes frying until chickpeas have turn a darker shade of brown. Small black spots, burning, won't overly affect the flavour. Pour out all chickpeas into bowl

Reheat the pan and add remaining oil and finely chopped onion. Stir gently until the onion softened, but not too browned. Add garlic and ginger, and turn heat down a little and gently fry. When garlic has softened, add coriander and cumin, stir gently and frequently to temper spices without them burning for two to three minutes

Add chopped tomatoes and chickpeas, and stir together, simmer until the sauce is very thick. Stir frequently so it doesn't burn or catch in the pan. The longer you cook it the better it gets. Slowly add the reserved chickpea liquid if you want to cook for even longer, just stop cooking when the sauce gets very thick

Stir in chopped parsley, coriander, mint, and lemon juice and simmer another few minutes

Cool and store in refrigerator overnight

Reheat in microwave or gently in a pan to serve
