Tasty hot lunch, and a great use of leftover potatoes

## Ingredients

* 400 g (2 cups) flour
* 3 eggs
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* milk to mix
* butter
* fillings?

## Method

Mix flour and baking powder, add eggs, gradually beat in milk until batter or correct consistency is reached (thick, not very pourable, but still flows enough to form drops)

Add a filling , try, canned sweet corn, fish, chopped corned beef, apple, pineapple, banana, corn and bacon, cheese and onion ...

If filling has surplus liquid, use that, and less milk when mixing

Fry large spoonfuls in butter until golden brown

Serve with a crisp salad. Pour on the tomato sauce, or your favourite relish
