The base for an amazing artistic icing creation, cupcakes are popular with most people, and especially your mum on mother’s day!

## Ingredients

* 125 g butter
* 1 tsp vanilla essence
* ½ cup sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1 cup plain flour
* 2 tsp baking powder
* ¼ cup milk

## Equipment

* Baking trays
* Mixing bowl x 2
* Medium saucepan
* Mixing spoon

## Method

Cream butter, vanilla and sugar until light and fluffy

Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition

Sift flour and baking powder together, and then fold (do not stir unless you want rock cakes) into the creamed mixture

Gently stir in the milk

Spoon the mixture evenly into patty cases in a muffin tin. Do not fill past the 2/3 mark as they will expand. If you are not using patty cases (paper liners) remember to butter or oil the muffin tins first

Bake at 190°C for 15 to 20 minutes (or until cupcake springs back when lightly touched)

Transfer to a cooling rack and ice when cold
