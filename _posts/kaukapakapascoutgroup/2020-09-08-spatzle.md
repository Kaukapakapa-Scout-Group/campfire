A traditional German boiled noodle or dumpling. Literally translated Spätzle means "little sparrow"

## Ingredients

* 1 large egg
* 125 g flour (1 cup)
* ½ tsp. salt
* ¼ water or more to mix to a thick, but smooth batter

## Equipment

* Mixing bowl
* Fork
* Medium saucepan
* Rubber scraper or spatula
* Large holed colander or steamer pot or Spätzle machine
* Small sieve or slotted spoon
* Large sieve or another colander
* Serving bowl

## Method

Mix dry ingredients with a fork, and make a well to put egg and water into. Add egg and water. The mixture should be thick, but smooth, add more water if necessary

Bring one to two litres of water to the boil. Add some salt

Using a large holed colander scrape the mixture through the holes into the boiling water. Work quickly in three batches

When the Spätzle rises to surface and have been in the boiling water for a few minutes use a small sieve or slotted spoon to remove and drain in another large sieve or colander

Add to a bowl and mix in a little butter or olive oil to stop them sticking together, or lightly fry in some butter

You can spice them with a pinch of nutmeg and/or pepper

To make longer Spätzle you need soft dough and a good scraping technique
