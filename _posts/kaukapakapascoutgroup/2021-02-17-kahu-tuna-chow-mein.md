A tasty and quick asian style dish 

## Ingredients

* 1 tins of tuna, packed in oil
* 1½ tablespoons flour
* ½ cup chopped onion
* 1 to 1½ cups stock
* 1 cup sliced mushrooms
* 1½ cups diced celery
* 1 cup sliced water chestnuts (optional)
* 3 TO 4 tablespoons soy sauce
* 250 g dried noodles

## Method

Drain tuna, reserving oil

Heat oil in fry pan, add onion, mushrooms and celery and cook for 5 minutes

Add more oil if necessary. Mix flour with a little cold water, and blend in, then add stock

Simmer uncovered until vegetables are soft. Add tuna, chestnuts, and soy sauce. Briefly mix, do not stir too much

For the noodles, bring a large pot of water to the boil. Add noodles to rapidly boiling water. Cook until tender (between 2 to 8 minutes depending on thickness of noodle)

Overcooked noodles will go mushy, so keep them on the firm side. Drain into a colander, and serve immediately, or add a knob of butter or a little oil to prevent the noddles from sticking to each other

Serve with noodles on top. Garnish with green peas or parsley

This dish without noodles, often with more vegetables variety and/or quantity is called a **Chop Suey**. Both these names refer to europeanised Asian dishes
