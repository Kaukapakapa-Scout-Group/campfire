New Zealand and Australia share a tradition of Anzac Biscuits. Both countries claim to have invented them, but Anzac Biscuits are similar to many other older biscuit recipes that are designed to produce crisp, hard and nutritious biscuits that keep well. These were first known as Soldiers' Biscuits, but after the Gallipoli landings in 1915, they became known as Anzac Biscuits

## Ingredients

* 1 cup desiccated coconut
* 1 cup flour
* 1 cup rolled oats
* 1 cup sugar
* 100 g butter
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 2 tbsp golden syrup
* 2 tbsp hot water

## Equipment

* Baking trays
* Mixing bowl x 2
* Medium saucepan
* Mixing spoon

## Method

Gently melt butter in a saucepan and add golden syrup

Mix first four dry ingredients together

Dissolve baking soda in hot water and then stir into butter mixture (it will froth up violently) and pour immediately into dry ingredients. Mix together quickly

Place level tablespoon amounts onto a lightly buttered baking tray, or baking paper and flatten a bit

Leave one finger width between each biscuit for expansion

Bake at 180°C for 15 to 20 minutes until a rich brown colour

Leave to harden before attempting to remove from tray

If you want crispier biscuits, cook the golden syrup longer so it start to become candy
 
## History

New Zealand and Australia share a tradition of Anzac Biscuits. Both countries claim to have invented them, but Anzac Biscuits are similar to many other older biscuit recipes that are designed to produce crisp, hard and nutritious biscuits that keep well

One of the food items that women in both countries sent to soldiers during the First World War was a hard, long-keeping biscuit that could survive the journey by sea, and still remain edible. Soldiers themselves may have made a similar form of biscuit from ingredients they had on hand: water, sugar, rolled oats and flour

The traditional Anzac Biscuit is hard and flat - ideal for dunking in tea and then eating. During the First World War, some soldiers used broken biscuits to make a form of porridge to add some variety to their diet

Over the years, softer and chewier versions of the biscuit have appeared. There are many recipes for Anzac Biscuits. Common to most is the inclusion of rolled oats, coconut, butter and golden syrup. Eggs almost never feature. This may be because eggs were in short supply during the First World War. Many varieties of biscuit do not have eggs, however, and like Anzac Biscuits rely instead on chemical rising agents such as bicarbonate of soda (baking soda)

## Use of the term 'Anzac'

The importance of 'Anzac' to New Zealand is enshrined in law. The use of the term 'Anzac' has been protected since 1916. The current Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981 (section 17) states says that, 'The Governor-General may... prohibit, regulate, or control the use in connection with any business, trade, or occupation of the word "Anzac" or of any other word that so closely resembles the word "Anzac" as to be likely to deceive or mislead any person

In practice this means that the term 'Anzac' cannot be used for any commercial venture. It is also protected under international copyright laws
