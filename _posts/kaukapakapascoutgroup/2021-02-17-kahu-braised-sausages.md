A traditional English dinner

## Ingredients

* 12 sausages 
* 2 onions, sliced
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 2 tablespoons beef stock powder
* 1 l water 
* 6 tablespoons flour
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce

## Method

Brown sausages in butter in frying pan, and then transfer to a large pot

Fry onions in frying pan until cooked, keep them moving all the time to avoid sticking to the pan and burning

When cooked, add the soy and Worcestershire sauce, and stock powder mixed with the water to the onions and allow to cook for a few minutes

Mix the flour with a little water into a creamy paste and add to the onion mixture

Cook on a low heat until the sauce has thickened and the floury taste has gone, then pour over the sausages and simmer until the sausages are hot, then serve with vegetables
