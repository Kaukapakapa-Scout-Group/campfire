A creamy sweet mess, make everything better on a cold day

## Ingredients

* 4 cups short grained rice
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 2 cups sultanas or dried fruit
* 1 egg
* 1 can condensed milk (optional)

## Method

Wash rice well under cold water until no colour washes out

Place in a pot and cover with 2 cm of water above rice level

Add sultanas or dried fruit and bring to the boil

Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes until rice is cooked. Check it regularly

Stir and add more water if required to prevent sticking on and burning

Drain rice and stir in well beaten egg, sugar, and condensed milk
