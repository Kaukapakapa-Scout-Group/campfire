Always looks like an alien. Great on toast or on top of a fry up

Half fill a billy or deep fry pan with water and bring to a boil

Carefully break one or two eggs per person into the boiling water

Put the lid on and remove from fire and let stand for about 4 minutes or longer if hard eggs are wanted
