Simple to cook, economic ingredients, and very tasty. An ideal winter camp meal

## Ingredients

* 1 Kg braising steak (slow cook)
* 3 medium onions, sliced
* 6 teaspoons stock powder (or 3 cups real stock)
* 1 tablespoon of flour
* 1 tablespoon of oil
* 1 medium cauliflower
* 750 g carrots
* 1.5 kg potatoes

## Method

Cut steak into medium sized pieces (2 cm), and dust with flour

Heat oil in large deep frypan, or heavy bottom pot. Add steak and onions, and frequently but gentry turn until all steak surfaces are brown

Add three cups of water and stock powder or 3 cups of stock and simmer gently for 45 minutes

Stir occasionally and add water as required

At the same time, prepare vegetables into bite sized chunks. You only need to peel vegetables if the skin is old, dark, and wrinkled. Good quality fresh vegetables only require washing

Steam the vegetables in a large pot with some water. Carrots and potatoes 20 minutes, cauliflower 10 minutes

Serve braised steak and it's gravy over the chunky vegetables, and some fresh oregano or parsley
