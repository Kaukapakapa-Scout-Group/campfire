An European-Asian fusion dish, intense flavours, and always popular

## Ingredients

* 1 Kg mince
* 3 onions
* 2 carrots
* 1 stick celery
* 1 tin (425 g) pineapple pieces
* 2 tablespoons oil
* 5 tablespoons flour
* 100 ml soy sauce
* 100 ml vinegar
* 2 teaspoons beef stock powder
* 2 packets Maggi sweet and sour mix
* [cooked rice](/kahu-rice/) to serve

## Meatball Method

Finely chop 1 onion and add to mince. Sprinkle beef stock powder over the mince, and mix well

Make into meatballs the size of golf balls

Place oil into frying pan, or on the grill plate, and cook meatballs until done

## Sweet and Sour Sauce Method

Slice 2 onions, carrots, and celery

Saut√© in a frying pan lightly with a little oil or butter

Add pineapple pieces and its juice, dissolved sweet and sour mix (use a little water), soya sauce, and vinegar

Cook over a low flame until vegetables are just starting to be cooked

Mix flour with a little water into a creamy paste and slowly add. Simmer until thickened, 10 minutes

Take care not to over-cook vegetables; they should be still slightly crisp

Serve meatballs on cooked rice, and pour over sauce
