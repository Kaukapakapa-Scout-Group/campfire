Flip and enjoy with you favourite topping. Try something savoury too

## Ingredients

* 3 cups plain flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 3 eggs
* 3Â¾ cups milk
* oil or butter for the pan
* lemon, sugar, golden syrup, jam to put on pancakes

## Method

Place flour and baking powder into a mixing bowl, mix well

Add the milk and eggs. Beat until smooth, but don't beat for too long, or you will have tough pancakes

Set aside for one hour for the flour to fully hydrate

Gently heat a lightly greased frying or pancake pan

Pour about a small ladle (3 tablespoons) into the pan

Tilt the pan, or use a spreading bar, to ensure even spread of mixture

Lift and edge with a fish knife to check when golden, then flip it over and cooked the other side (try using the pan handle flip technique, great fun to practise)

Sprinkle with sugar, lemon juice, or jam, roll and serve hot

Try a savory filling like pate, left-over cold cuts, beans, or left-over salad ... it's a soft burrito
