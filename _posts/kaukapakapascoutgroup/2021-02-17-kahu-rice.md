Great under a saucy casserole or curry, or part of a fancy salad

## Ingredients

* 500 g (2 cups) rice
* water

## Boiling Method

Fill a large pot with a lid with 1500 ml of water water, and bring to the boil

When boiling stir in the rice, and ensure it is not sticking to the bottom. Stir occasionally while cooking

Boil for 10 to 15 minutes or until soft

Strain in a colander, and rinse if required

The boiling method is quick, and good for firm cooked rice, and it separates easily. Often used in cold rice dishes, salads etc

## Absorption Method

Fill a large pot with a good fitting lid with 1000 ml of water (1:2 ratio), and bring to the boil

When boiling stir in the rice, and ensure it is not sticking to the bottom

Simmer for 20 minutes or until soft. Keep the lid on tightly until all the water has been absorbed

If you get the ratio of rice to water correct, all the water will have absorbed  by the time it is finished cooking, and no rinsing will be required

This method is how most cultures cook rice, and result in soft fluffy rice

For other rice types; basmati, sushi, long grain etc, refer to the packet for best water ratio and cooking times
