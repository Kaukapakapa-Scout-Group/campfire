An English favourite, we can imagine B.P. tucking into this at camp. Works well in a dutch oven on embers

## Ingredients

* 500 g trifle sponge
* 3 tablespoons jam
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 2 packets red jelly crystals
* 500 ml milk
* 4 tablespoons custard powder

## Method

Crumble trifle sponge into a suitable dish

Mix in jam and pour hot jelly (made up as per instructions on the box) over the top and mix into sponge

Make the custard using 500 ml milk, 4 tablespoons custard powder, and two tablespoons of sugar. Pour over the sponge

Note Trifle is best made earlier in the day (requires 1-2 hours to set)

Serve with fruit and cream
