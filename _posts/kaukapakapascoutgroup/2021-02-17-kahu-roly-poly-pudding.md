An English favourite, we can imagine B.P. tucking into this at camp. Works well in a dutch oven on embers

## Ingredients

* 230 g plain flour
* I raised teaspoon baking powder
* 125 g shredded suet (hard animal of vegetable fat), butter also works
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* cold water to mix
* jam 

## Method

Mix together flour, salt, baking powder, and suet. Add sufficient water to make a stiff dough

Roll or press into an oval shape about 5 mm thick

Spread jam over, leaving a margin around the edges

Wet edges, and roll up and seal ends

Place roll in a pudding cloth and tie ends with string. Leave room for pudding to expand

Simmer for two hours, serve with [custard](/kahu-quick-custard/)
