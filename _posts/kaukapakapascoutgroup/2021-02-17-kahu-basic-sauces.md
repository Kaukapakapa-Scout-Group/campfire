Sauces make some foods more presentable, and allow deeper and richer flavours and textures. Lets start with

**Basic White Sauce**

## Ingredients

* 50 g plain flour
* 600 ml milk
* 50 g butter

## Method

Melt the butter in a pot

Sift or scatter in the flour, mix and cook for a few minutes over gentle heat

Add warmed milk, gradually stirring continuously to remove any lumps

Now add any required flavour ingredients _(see below)_

Allow to simmer for a few minutes until rich and creamy


**Egg Sauce**

Add two hard boiled eggs that have been diced up

**Cheese Sauce (Mornay)**

Add 75 g grated cheese

**Parsley Sauce**

Add one teaspoonful of chopped parsley
