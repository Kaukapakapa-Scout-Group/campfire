Great with a tomato-based sauce, or part of a fancy salad

## Ingredients

* 500 g (2 cups) dried pasta
* 4 times the pasta volume of water

## Method

Fill a large pot with the water, and bring to a boil

Add the pasta and stir to separate pasta and stop it clumping together

Cook pasta for 7 to 12 minutes, until tender. Time depends on pasta type (thickness of shape). Refer to packet for expected times

To stop over boiling of pasta water, add a teaspoon of oil, but avoid this if pasta is going to be sauced, as this stop the sauce sticking to the pasta

Drain well in a colander
