Holishkes are stuffed cabbage rolls, usually a ground meat and rice, and covered with tomato sauce. A quick shortcut is to wrap sausages in softened cabbages leaves, and bake until fully cooked

The Jewish culture brought us great foods like

* Bagels (boiled and baked rounds of yeasty bread)
* Corned beef (salt curing meat)
* Cheese cake (sweet cultured milk and cream, optionally baked)
* Macaroons (very delicious flour free cookies)

The Jewish culture encourages strict periods of not working, fasting (not eating), or only eating certain things at certain times. So these types of foods have evolved from that restricted culture

## Wrappers

* 1 large cabbage or savoy cabbage

Boiled or steam to soften, so that whole leaves can be pulled off. Shred leftovers as base for oven dish

Shave off thick parts of stems so leafs can be tightly rolled

## Filling

* 750g ground beef
* 1 cup cooked brown rice (optional), or shredded vegetables, cabbage, etc
* 1/3 cup finely minced onion
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 egg
* generous amount of dried marjoram and ground paprika
* salt and pepper to taste

Mix by hand, do not over mix

## Sauce

* 500 g tomatoes
* 1 can crushed tomatoes
* 1/3 cup finely minced onion
* 1 clove minced garlic
* ½ cup stock
* Salt and pepper to taste

Simmer for 60 minutes to make a fragrant to sauce

## Assembly

Wrap a small handful of filling in a leaf, just as you would wrap a Mexican burrito, try to tuck ends in so they stay rolled

Place seam down in large oiled baking dish or deep edged oven tray

Pour over sauce and bake for an hour or more at 180°C
