Serve hot on cold

## Ingredients

* 1½ tablespoons butter
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1 tablespoon plain flour
* 600 ml milk
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 1 egg

## Method

Cream butter and sugar together

Add the beaten egg. Stir in flour and beat until smooth

Flavour with vanilla

Slowly stir in boiling milk

Pour into a leak-proof baking  dish

Stand dish in a baking tray of water, and cook slowly for about ¾ hour, until firm to touch and golden on top

If you have a kitchen blow-torch, sprinkle brown sugar on top after it is cooked, and carefully caramelize the sugar. If you do this well, you can call it a _creme brulee_
