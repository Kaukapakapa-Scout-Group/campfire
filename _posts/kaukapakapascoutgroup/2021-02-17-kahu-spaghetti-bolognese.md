_Spag-bol_, the classic italian meat sauce, goes well on most pasta shapes. Serve with a crisp salad, or hot steamed veges

## Ingredients

* 1 Kg ground beef
* 2 onions, finely chopped
* 3 teaspoons mixed herbs
* 720 g spaghetti
* 2 tablespoons oil
* 425 g ( 1 can) savoury tomatoes
* 4 cups hot water
* 250 g grated cheese

## Method

Heat oil in a large frying pan, and fry the onion until soft

Add mince, break up chucks, and cook until light brown, stirring until all red has gone

Add tomatoes, herbs, and water. Mix together gently until it starts to boil. Place on low heat and simmer for 30 minutes or until almost all the liquid has evaporated

Place spaghetti into a large pot of boiling water, stir and boil for 10 minutes until just soft. Drain well in a colander

Serve mince sauce over the top of the macaroni, or mix it all together as your patrol likes? Sprinkle grated cheese on top
