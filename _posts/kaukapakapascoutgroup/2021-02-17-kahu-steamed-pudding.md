A classic hot pudding, and a new cooking technique to learn

## Ingredients

* ½ cup jam
* 1½ cups plain flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 60 g butter
* ½ cup castor sugar
* ½ cup milk
* 1 egg

## Method

Grease a small billy or pudding basin. Spread jam in the base

In another bowl beat butter, sugar, and egg until smooth and creamy

Sift in flour and baking powder

Add milk and mix well

Spread mixture carefully on top of jam in billy or pudding basin

Make a foil lid, press the edges to seal tight and make a string handle for it

Lower pudding basin into a larger pot of boiling water, approximately 5cm deep

Place lid on pot and simmer on low heat for one hour. Keep refilling with water as needed

Run a knife around the edge of the pudding, and tip onto a serving plate. Serve with [custard](/kahu-quick-custard/)
