All the Scouts from [Kaukapakapa Scout Group](/authors#12042) rave about this, and have been ruined from any other form of pumpkin soup since

## Ingredients

* l medium pumpkin
* 2 large onions
* ~Â½ l milk
* 200 g grated cheese
* 3 teaspoons sugar
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 250 ml cream
* small bunch of parsley

## Method

Peel and chop pumpkin into small pieces

Finely chop onion

Place pumpkin, onion, and sugar in sufficient water to barley cover, and simmer until tender. About one hour

Strain surplus liquid into a container and mash vegetables into a puree

Measure cup by cup into a pot, and add 1/2 cup of milk to each ucp of puree

Add surplus liquid to desired consistency

Re-heat, but do not boil _[or milk will split]_. Stir in tablespoons of butter, and simmer to serving temperature

To serve soup, add cream, sprinkle with grated cheese, and finely chopped parsley
