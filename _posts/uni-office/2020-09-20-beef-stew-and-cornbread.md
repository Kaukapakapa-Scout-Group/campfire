There’s nothing quite like a one pot stew and cornbread meal when camping

Stew can be cooked on a slow gas hob, on fire embers, or dutch oven. Cornbread required dutch oven

6 serves

## Ingredients - Beef Stew

* 1 Tbsp oil
* 1 kg trimmed stewing or gravy beef in medium (15 mm) chunks
* 1 x onion cut into medium (10 mm) pieces
* 3 x cloves garlic finely chopped
* salt and pepper to taste
* 3 Tbsp tomato paste
* 2 Tbsp flour
* 600 ml beef broth, 1 condensed stock tub, or 2 x beef cubes, add water to make up 600 ml
* 6 x medium potatoes cut into 20 mm chunks
* 3 x carrots cut into 20 mm chunks

## Ingredients - Cornbread

* 1 cup milk
* 1 egg
* 2 Tbsp honey
* 1 cup fine cornmeal
* ½ cup Flour
* 1 Tbsp baking powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 100g of mild green chilies
* ¼ cup of cheddar cheese
* 2 Tbsp butter

## Method - Beef Stew

Heat oil and brown the beef in small batches, this will take about 10 to 15 minutes

To the beef, add onion, garlic, cook for about 5 minutes until softened

Season with salt & pepper and add tomato paste and mix to coat everything 

Sprinkle on the flour and coat everything, make sure the flour is well absorbed 

Slowly add the beef broth.  Add enough water to cover the meat by about 25mm

Cover and cook for about an hour

Add potatoes and carrots and cook for another 20 to 30 minutes. If using a hot box add these before inserting in the hot box for 4 to 5 hours

Add more salt and pepper to taste before serving

## Method - Cornbread

Beat the egg in a bowl, and add the milk, honey, and mix well. Add all the dry ingredients, and mix enough to combine, but do not over mix (it will go tough)

Heat a dutch oven on hot embers and melt the butter coat bottom and sides or use baking paper and then butter on the baking paperPour in the cornbread mixture, sprinkle the green chili’s across the top and put on the lid

Cover the dutch oven with embers and let cook for about 25 minutes, adding embers if needed

Serve stew and bread with salad or fresh veges
