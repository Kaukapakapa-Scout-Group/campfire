## Menu Calculator

The Upper North Island Territory has developed two calculators that new leaders may find helpful when planning camps and events

The calculators cope with the complexity of Scout events such as, different numbers attending on different days, different forms of transport, meals differing greatly from day to day, and the different forms of charges for camp venues

[Camp Food Costing Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZCSVScqPenvWpy3Q8i_ewHI3KqP6QHr2HHTRYT9K_SQ/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}

[Scout Event budget Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OPbwoCotqEuQumG1J19Rm7mIw-Ah4KKnQ-kvyeAWxu8/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}

This is an example of the worksheet for costing one breakfast for 30 people. Each meal is costed out separately as the menus vary from day to day, as can the number of people attending.
