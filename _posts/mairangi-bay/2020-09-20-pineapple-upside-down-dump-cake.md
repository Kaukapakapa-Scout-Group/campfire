10 serves

## Ingredients

* 1 can pineapple rings, reserve the syrup
* 8 maraschino cherries (optional)
* 120 g butter
* 1/2 Tbs corn or wheat starch
* 1/4 cup reserved pineapple juice
* 1 Tbs cinnamon
* 3 Tbs brown sugar
* 1 pinch of salt
* 1 box cake mix, white or yellow (about 500 g)
* 1/2 cup of lemonade, or any simple soda
* 1/2 cup of the reserved pineapple juice

## Method

Start your charcoal 15 minutes ahead. Use a 30 cm Dutch Oven, apply a coating of oil

Melt 2 Tbs of the butter in the bottom of the Dutch Oven. Whisk in the corn starch and heat until bubbly. Whisk in the 1/4 cup pineapple juice and heat until thickened. Adjust corn starch until the butter juice mixture is like thick gravy. Add half the Cinnamon, Half the Brown sugar and a good shake of salt. Whisk together

Arrange the pineapple slices into the thicken mixture in the bottom of the Dutch Oven. Optionally place a Cherry in the center hole of each pineapple slice

Dump the dry cake mix on top of the pineapple slices and spread evenly

Chop the remaining butter in chunks and distribute over the dry cake mix

Pour the rest of the reserved pineapple syrup and soda over the entire top of the cake mix best you can

Sprinkle the remaining Cinnamon and brown sugar over the top

Cover the Dutch Oven with its lid. Aiming for hot coals of 180 C

Place dutch oven on a half the oven diameter of hot coals, and place twice that amount of hot coals on top

Bake about 45 to 60 minutes until a skewer or knife comes out clean

Once removed from the heat and cooled about 15 minutes the Dutch Oven can be quickly flipped and down hard on aboard, paper plate, or the Dutch Oven lid to serve with the pineapple slices on top

Serve warm with ice cream, or whipped cream
