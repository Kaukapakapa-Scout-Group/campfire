Can be cooked on a gas hob, open fire embers, or camp over

10 serves

## Ingredients

* 1 Tbs oil
* 1 large or 2 medium sized onions – chopped small
* 2 to 3 cloves garlic – chopped or crushed
* 500 to 600g mince
* 2 rounded teaspoons ground cumin
* 2 teaspoons dried oregano
* pinch of chilli powder – if the patrol wants this
* plenty of black pepper
* 2 cans diced tomatoes in puree
* 1 sachet tomato paste, ~200 g
* 1 ½ cups red lentils
* 2 carrots – grated
* salt and more pepper if needed
* 2 cans red kidney beans
* water as needed

## Method

Heat the oil gently in a large pan or pot.  Sauté the chopped onion and garlic until transparent.

Add the mince and stir and break up until brown all over.

Add the cumin, oregano, chilli and pepper, and stir around until fragrant.  Just a few seconds.

Add the tomatoes and enough water to make quite a wet/sloppy mixture.

Bring to the boil, then pour in the red lentils.  Stir well and bring back to a simmer.

Cook gently for about 20 minutes, until lentils are soft – add more water if it gets too dry.

Stir in grated carrots.

Drain and rinse the kidney beans, then stir them in too.

Taste and add salt, half a teaspoon at a time until it is delicious.

Serve with corn chips (warmed optional), grated cheese, a dollop of sour cream and fresh veges or salads
